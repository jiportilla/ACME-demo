## 1. Introductions

Hello, I am ____`<your-name>`____ wtih the `IBM Edge Application Manager` (IEAM) team.

IEAM provides highly secure and robust application lifecycle management for literally thousands of edge machines regardless of their hardware and software differences. Our fully autonomous Agents transparently work through firewalls, and continue to function effectively even when network connectivity is intermittent.


Let's take a look at how our policy deployment feature autonomously controls workload installation and update for devices with differing capabilities in a retail environment. 

ACME is a fictional nationwide security company that offers various video cameras. They want to add video analytics to some of those cameras to detect motion and measure social distance.

![ACME Demo](acme.png)

Let's take a look at the IBM Edge Application Manager dashboard for ACME's cameras:

* Go to the IEAM dashboard mock-up

	[Management Hub](http://icp.com/edge)
	

## 2. IEAM Management Hub
The `dashboard` resides in the your `Management Hub` which can be placed wherever appropriate (for example, in a public cloud, or a regional data center, or even inside a factory, completely air-gapped from the Internet).

The `dashboard` enables you to see and interact with all of your edge assets in one place, regardless of their physical locations or current connection status. These edge machines may be geographically distributed or concentrated in one location. The `Agents` on these edge machines are fully autonomous, are able to reach out to the Management Hub through firewalls when needed. They also tolerate unreliable and intermittent connectivity to the Management Hub.

![IEAM Hub](edge-hub.png)

Notice the dashboard has 4 tabs: `Nodes`, `Services`, `Patterns` and `Policies`. Let's take a look at the `Nodes` tab first:

* Go to the `Nodes` tab

	[Management Hub](http://icp.com/edge)
	
The `nodes` represent your edge machines. Here you can view and interact with your nodes. It will show all of you registered devices, their assigned software and their last reported status.


What you are looking at now is `graphical` node summary.


You can also view your edge nodes as a `list`.

* Go to the `List` view:

	[Management Hub](http://icp.com/edge)
	
	* diagram goes here

The `list` view shows additional details that are not visible in a graph layout, like `node owner` and last `heartbeat`. If you select an individual node in the list view you can see even more details.

* Go to the ACME `DEV` node

	![IEAM Dev Node](edge-dev.png)

Notice ACME `DEV's` current configuration of `properties` and `constraints`. 
These `properties` and `constraints` comprise this node's `policy`, and enable this node to identify its capabilities and highlight its differences. When combined with other policies, it will also inform the type of workloads it will run.

Notice no edge services are running on the Dev node.

* Optional

	Register `CAM-A` and `CAM-B` nodes using the `CLI` command:

	`hzn register` 

	on each of the two CAM nodes VMs
	
	* video goes here
	
Next, let's explore `CAM-A` settings:

## 2.1 CAM-A Details

* Go to the `CAM-A` node

	[Management Hub](http://icp.com/edge)

Notice `CAM-A's` current configuration of `properties` and `constraints`. 
These `properties` and `constraints` comprise this node's `policy`, and enable this node to identify its capabilities and highlight its differences. When combined with other policies, it will also inform the type of workloads it will run.


Update the `properties` of `CAM-A `with with:

`type=SecurityCam` 

and 

`GPU-enabled=false`

The latter is used here to indicate that this camera does not contain a video processing accelerator. This camera will only be able to run simple security workloads, and not video analytic workloads. 

`CAM-A` also states a `constraint` that it will only accept software deployment policies that specify the  `purpose` property with a `security-monitoring` value.

Update `CAM-A` constraints with:

```
	"constraints": [
    	"purpose == security-monitoring"
  	]
```

* Note also that currently there are no services running on this node.

* video goes here

Now let's examine `CAM-B`

## 2.2 CAM-B Details

`(Describe the steps as you move to CAM-B)`

* Go to the `CAM-B` node

	[Management Hub](http://icp.com/edge)
	
Update `CAM-B` properties with:

`type=SmartCam` 

and 

`GPU-enabled=true`

`CAM-B` has a video processing accelerator which means it will be able to run both security and video analytic workloads. 

Update `CAM-B`with a constraint that it will accept software deployment policies that specify the properties: `purpose=security-monitoring` or  `purpose=smart-video-analytics`


Update `CAM-B` `constraints` With:

```
 "constraints": [
        "purpose == security-monitoring OR purpose == smart-video-analytics"
    ]
```

* video goes here

* Like `CAM-A`, note that currently there are no services running on this `CAM-B` node.
	
# 3. Service & Deployment Policies

Now let's learn about edge `services`: 

`(Describe the steps to get to the Services tab)`

* Go to the `Services` tab `(via Node or Home links)`

	[Management Hub](http://icp.com/edge)
	
	* Diagram goes here
	
An `IEAM service` can contain one or more `Docker` container images. A group of  one or more services together can create an application.


The `Services` tab lists all the available services that have been published into the `IEAM Exchange` (to make them available for deployment to your edge nodes).


Let's find the service with the ID: `acme-motion-detection-service`. 

Let's use the search bar.

`(Describe the steps to open the tile for this service).`


* Click in `Find services`
* Select to search by `Service ID` in the popup menu
* Select `acme-motion-detection-service` in the popup menu 
* Select the `acme-motion-detection-service` tile

* Diagram goes here

Notice `acme-motion-detection-service` current configuration of `properties` and `constraints`. 
These properties and constraints comprise this service's `policy`, and enable this service to identify its purpose and any specialized requirements it may have. When combined with other policies, it will help to determine on which edge nodes this service will run.


Within the properties of `acme-motion-detection-service` we see that it identifies itself with `purpose=security-monitoring`. 

Perhaps you will recall that both `CAM-A` and `CAM-B` stated the constraint that `purpose == security-monitoring`, so this service seems appropriate for both cameras.


The `acme-motion-detection-service` also states a `constraint` that it requires at least `1024 MB` of memory. The IEAM Agent automatically provides node properties that identify the amount of memory on the node, so this type of constraint can be used even without manually setting any node properties. 

If needed, update this value as follows:

```
	"constraints": [
    	"openhorizon.memory >= 1024"
  	] 
```

Now let's look at deploying this software onto some edge nodes.


## 4. Deployment policy CPU

* Click at the bottom of the screen to jump down to the `Deployment` section


Notice that there are currently no `deployment` polices for this service. Let's create one.

`(Describe steps to create, name and describe a new deployment policy).`


* Click: `Create deployment policy`
* Click in the `Enter a name` field (will autofill) 
* Click in the `Create a description for your policy` field (will autofill)


Now let's consider which nodes should run this workload.  This is done by adding `constraints` which must be valid on all devices that need to run this service. These `constraints` are logical expressions that that are evaluated against the `properties` in each node's `policies`.

Create a `constraint` that states the node's `type` property must be equal to `SecurityCam` in order for this service to be run on the node.

`(Describe the steps)`

Update `policy` values with:

```
	{
     	"constraints": [
    		"type == SecurityCam"
  		] 
    }
```
 

* Normally click `Add constraints` at top left, but here, click `Next` at top right
* Click `Enter Property Name`, select `type`
* Click `Select an Operator`, select `is equal to`
* Click `Enter Property Value`, select `SecurityCam`


By specifying the `type` must be `SecurityCam`, this `deployment` policy will only be run on `CAM-A` that has this `type` property, but not on  `CAM-B` which has `type=SmartCam` property.

Note that `properties` can have any names and values you wish that are appropriate for your circumstances. And similarly, `constraints` can refer to any `properties` you have set, and you can specify conditions for the values of those `properties` using the wide variety of operators provided.

* Click `Next` at top right

The next screen is for the `rollback` feature, which we will not be using here.

* Click `Next` at top right

Let's review this `policy` and activate it using the `deploy service` button:

* Click `Deploy service` at top right

* Diagram/video goes here

## 5. Agreement negotiations

Once the service deployment is saved, then things will begin to happen autonomously in the background. Your autonomous Agreement Robots (AgBots) in the `Management Hub` will notice this policy and will begin negotiations with your autonomous `Agents` on each of your registered edge nodes to suggest that those `Agents` should consider running the associated service workload. 

Each `Agent` will then evaluate the `AgBot`'s proposal based on its local `policy` and will decide whether or not it is appropriate to accept the `agreement` and begin validating the workload, and eventually, if appropriate, to run the workload.

Now move back to the `Nodes` tab to watch this service being deployed. 

`(Describe steps, and show service start running on CAM-A but not on CAM-B)`


* Click `Next` at top right
* Click on `CAM-A`, look at services
* Click on `CAM-B`, look at services

* Diagram/video goes here
*
## 6. GPU Deployment Policy


Let's return to the `Services` tab in the browser and deploy another `service`.

Search for the `acme-motion-detection-service-gpu` service.

* Click on the `Service` tab
* Click in `Find services`
* Select to search by `Service ID` in the popup menu
* Select `acme-motion-detection-service-gpu` in the popup menu
* Select the `acme-motion-detection-service-gpu` tile

Note the `service` properties section for this newly published service.

* Click at the bottom of the screen to jump down to the `Deployment` section

Note also that there is no `deployment` policy. Like before, let's create one. 

(Describe the steps)

* Click: `Create deployment policy`, everything is autofilled
* Click: `Next`

This workload requires a video processing accelerator in order to perform adequately. To ensure nodes meet this requirement we will specify a `constraint` that the `GPUEnabled` property must be `true`.

```
"constraints": [
    "GPU-enabled == true"
  ]
```
* Click: `Next`

Again, we are skipping the `rollback` feature.

* Click: `Next`

Review the new `policy` details before deploying the `service`.


* Click: `Deploy service`

Now move back to the `Nodes` tab to watch this `service` being deployed. 

`(Describe steps, and show service start running on CAM-B but not on CAM-A)`


* Click `Next` at top right
* Click on `CAM-B`, look at services


Notice that tt is not deployed to `CAM-A` because this service requires the `GPU-enabled` property to be true.

* Click on `CAM-A`, look at services

* Diagram/video goes here

## 7. CAM-A Upgrade

The `CAM-A` edge machine is now going to be updated with a video accelerator (GPU), and we will then change its node `properties` to change `GPU-enabled` to `true` and to change the node's `constraints` to support both `purpose` values `security-monitoring` or `smart-video-analytics` workloads.

Update `CAM-A` property value:

```
	{
      "name": "GPU-enabled",
      "value": "true"
    }
```

And

```
	"constraints": [
    	"purpose == security-monitoring OR purpose == smart-video-analytics"
  	] 
```

This will result in `IEAM` autonomously (with no additional steps required) updating the software assigned to this node based on this new capability.


* Move back to the `Nodes` Tab
* Select `CAM-A`
* Make the two policy changes above (property and constraint)
* Review and update the node `policy` for `CAM-A`


Let's go back to the `Nodes` tab to observe `CAM-A`


* Again click the `Nodes` tab, select `CAM-A` to watch the results

Notice that `CAM-A`is now running both service workloads.


* Again click the `Nodes` tab, select `CAM-B`

Notice that `CAM-B` is still running this one service workload.

## 8. CAM-B Upgrade

* publish mms-object
* review mms/object.json constraints
* update cam-b properties (GPU-type=TPU)
* Show model updates

## 9. Summary
Today you have seen the `IBM Edge Application Manager` in action, performing autonomous application lifecycle management on a few example edge machines with hardware and software differences. You have watched our fully autonomous `Agents` work behind the scenes to autonomously manage workload installation and update for devices with differing capabilities in a retail environment. You have also heard that `IEAM` supports very large deployments of many thousands of edge machines.


You have seen that once you have deployed and configured our `Agent` on your machines, you will be able to use `IBM Edge Application Manager` to update policies to change what software runs on which edge machines. You will do this without ever again having to directly connect to any of those machines. Instead you will simply express your intent through our policy mechanism. The `IEAM` system will then work in the background to bring your entire fleet of node into compliance with your policies. This will save your operations team time and money. It will reduce risks from human error, and reduce the complexity of managing your entire fleet of edge machines.
